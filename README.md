# Market-Basket-Analysis

An Exploratory Data and a Market Basket Analysis on some public retail data (more info [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/online+retail)).

It aims to demonstrate how vital such an analysis can become in a retailer's marketing strategy with little effort.

Stores nowadays sit on enormous piles of **data** that contain lots of **unexploited value**. 

Such an analysis may put each entrepreneur **ahead of their competition**.

For example, in this certain dataset , strong associations are exhibited among
* tea plates of different colors
* certain napkins with certain papercups and plates (apparently for parties)
* some teacups-saucer sets with a cakestand
* certain pieces of christmas decoration
An so on.

Such insights may become gamechangers...
